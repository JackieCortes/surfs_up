# Module 9 - Surfs up

## **Overview of the analysis:**
Our customer wanted more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## **Results:**
Observing the results of June and December, we can say the following:

1) The max value is similar, the difference of 2 points is not significant.
2) The standard deviation has only an aprox. difference of 0.5
3) The percentiles kept in 25% and 50% the same difference of 3 units.
