# Module 9 - Surfs up

## **Overview of the analysis:**
Our customer wanted more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## **Results:**
Observing the results of June and December, we can mention the following similarities:

1) The max value has the difference of 2 points. This discrepancy is not significant.
2) The standard deviation has only an aprox. 0.5 in difference.
3) All percentiles kept the same gap of 3 or units between June and Dec. (Example Perc 25% June 73 vs. Perc 25% Dec 69)

## **Summary: **

It is possible to assume that the place has stable temperatures throughout the seasons, this is inferred by the percentiles distribution.
The only notable difference between the months would be in the minimum.
To offer more information for our client, I would like to suggest:
1) Histograms for the months to check the temperatures'distribution.
2) Plot the temperatures to see if there is a trend or an outlier.

A visutal analysis is important to review quickly the data and check if there is any irregular information.
